As the environment had reached a suitable state of development, this week the group discussed possible evaluation criteria for the challenge. The RangL project aims to collect best practice in the application of RL (and also other optimisation approaches) to control problems in industry. Thus while it would be possible to use only leaderboard scores, we decided to ask participants to submit a one-page executive summary of their approach, which would be considered in the overall evaluation.
