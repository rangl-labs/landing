Having decided the general shape of the challenge, today the project group agreed to begin working in an agile fashion through a GitHub project board. 

Excitingly, RangL was also invited to be part of the Net Zero Technology Centre's virtual showcase "Road to Glasgow: Destination Net Zero" at the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow in November 2021. A virtual exhibition booth will include "meet the developers" live sessions and a project video explaining the Pathways to Net Zero challenge.
