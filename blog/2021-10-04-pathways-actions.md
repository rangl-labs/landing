Today the group agreed a modification to the challenge outline: the RL agent will now directly specify the rate of deployment of offshore wind, blue and green hydrogen. This is achieved by allowing the RL environment to interact directly and repeatedly with the IEV spreadsheet model, both simplifying the approach and increasing its transparency and interpretability. Initial results from training an RL agent with this environment were shared and sense-checked.
